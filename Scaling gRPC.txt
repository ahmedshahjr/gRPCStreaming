Reuse gRPC channels => using grpc client factory
Connection concurrency => addiontal connection are created when stream limit is reached
Load Balancing => load balancing the grpc app
Keep alive pings => intital grpc calls are established quickly without a delay casued by connection reestablished
binary payloads => sending small binary payloads
